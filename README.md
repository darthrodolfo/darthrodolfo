## Hello There <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"></a>

My name is **Rodolfo**, also know as *"Darth"* like the Darth Vader from Star Wars hahaha.
I'm a software developer currently living in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil 
I've been working with software development since 2011. I've been studing and learning about software development and other concepts like UI/UX, Agile methods, and other subjects directly envolved on the process of software development. 

I'm passionate in being able to use my experience and knowledge to contribute on the process of creating awesome projects and solutions with great people.

I like being immersed in software development.
**So, for studying and learning I use these sources of knowledge:**
- People (Mentors & colleagues)
- Reading (Books, Articles, Medium).
- Courses
- :dart: Events
- Podcasts
- Reading and playing with other's code (Github & etc).


I've worked most of the time as a backend developer using .NET Framework, Relational and Non-Relational databases, consuming and building API's and other kinds of projects.

:school: Nowdays Im focused in mastering Flutter framework.

I have broad knowledge in software developer and UI/UX, as I felt in love with UX on the middle of my career.
