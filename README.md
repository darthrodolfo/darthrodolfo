### Senior Software Engineer | 15 Years of Experience
I am a Senior Software Engineer with 15 years of experience building scalable, mission-critical systems. While my core technical proficiency is rooted in Backend development and the .NET ecosystem, I stand out as a versatile generalist with comprehensive fullstack capabilities.

My expertise goes beyond the code: I bring a strong background in UX/UI and usability, allowing me to bridge the gap between complex backend architecture and seamless user experiences. I specialize in delivering high-performance, transactional solutions for the FinTech sector, always focusing on creating products that are as robust as they are user-centric.
